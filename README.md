I’m usually emotional and active person. My life is very diverse. I think that I have a charitable nature, because I always help people. I’m usually calm, but sometimes I can lose my temper and become either angry or sad. I like to laugh and joke. I have got a sense of humor. I’m hard-working and ambitious person. I set high goals for myself and I work hard to reach them. I’m sociable, so I have got a lot of friends. I appreciate people’s honesty, frankness and politeness. I don’t like when people are rude and aggressive.
